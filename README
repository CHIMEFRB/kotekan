== Build Instructions ==

The project is build using cmake, so you will need to install cmake 
before starting a build. 

To build everything:

% cd build
% cmake ..
% make

The binaries will be located in subdirs mirroring the source tree.
For example the correlator binary will be in build/correlator/

To just build one project:

cd build
cmake ..
cd <project you want to build>
make

This will build just that project plus any dependencies it has.
